## Overview

The [Sejm API](https://api.sejm.gov.pl/) facilitates access to comprehensive details about the terms, sittings, votings, votes, and MPs of the [Polish Sejm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sejm). However, it presents several challenges:

- Absence of primary and foreign keys.
- API documentation does not specify nullable constraints.
- Inconsistent handling of votings that involve single or multiple voting options.
- MPs are defined per term rather than being treated as continuous entities across different terms.

To address these issues, the following solutions have been implemented:

- Creation of a database that includes tables with [natural keys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_key), utilizing SHA-256 for hashing and enforced key constraints.
- Implementation of API response schema validation alongside null constraints within the database.
- Normalization of votings to accommodate single-option scenarios uniformly.

Furthermore, maintaining a local copy of the data ensures rapid access to the entire dataset, significantly enhancing analysis capabilities.

### Data quality notes

The Sejm API models MPs on a term-by-term basis rather than maintaining a continuous, global MP entity. Turning them into continuous entities is not a trival issue due to various inconsistencies originating from the Sejm API, including:

- Data entry errors, such as typos or inconsistent naming of birthplaces.
- Changes in an MP's last name, commonly due to marriage.
- Previously missing fields that have been added later and are integral to our primary key, like birthplace.

## Features

- [x] Built with **üêçPython** and **ü¶ÜDuckDB**.
- [x] Normalized data model with primary keys, foreign keys, and not null constrains.
- [x] Fast and reliable processing thanks to the custom client for [Sejm API](https://api.sejm.gov.pl/sejm/openapi/ui).
- [x] Able to resume work from a given term, sitting, and voting.

python -m sejm-scraper prepare-database
```

### 4. Start scraping

```console
python -m sejm-scraper start-pipeline
```

### 5. Resume scraping

#### From the latest available point in the database

```console
python -m sejm-scraper resume-pipeline
```

#### From a specific point

```console
python -m sejm-scraper resume-pipeline --term <number> [--sitting <number> [--voting <number>]]
```

### 6. See help

```console
python -m sejm-scraper --help
```

## Limitations

This project's scope is constrained by the data availability from the Sejm API:

1. Absence of MP data for term 2.
2. Limited to only term and MP data for terms 3 through 7 and votes data from term 8 onwards.
3. Absence of exact dates of becoming active or inactive for MPs as well as changing the party.
4. MP data bounded to terms, instead of treating them as continuous enitities.

To address the first two gaps, future development efforts should aim to source the missing data directly from the Sejm's official website. The data is not exposed directly on the webpage, but can be obtained by using the following URL pattern:

`https://sejm.gov.pl/sejm10.nsf/agent.xsp?symbol=glosowania&NrKadencji={term_number}&NrPosiedzenia={sitting_number}&NrGlosowania={voting_number}`

For example:

`https://sejm.gov.pl/sejm10.nsf/agent.xsp?symbol=glosowania&NrKadencji=3&NrPosiedzenia=6&NrGlosowania=2`
